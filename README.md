Social trivia app I made at Hack@Smith

This is a simple app that lets you create questions and link them to friends for answering. I wanted to finally start learning how to work the back end of a web app, so I started learning flask and redis a couple days before the hackathon. I watched a number of tutorials and Youtube, and then this app happened. I learned a lot of important concepts about databases through this project while finding a number of free resources like Microsoft's Azure services. Overall, it was a great learning experience.
